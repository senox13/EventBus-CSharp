# **EventBus C#**

A mostly* complete C# port of Minecraft Forge's [EventBus](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/EventBus) library. It is fully documented with XML comments and an included Sandcastle Help File Builder script, but has not been tested in production. **Bugs are to be expected.**

<sub>*Features of the original library which depend on class/access transformers have been omitted</sub>
